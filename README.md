# Ising model
Monte Carlo simulations for 2D Ising model

* sweep()
All spins are updated based on Metropolis algorithm in each time stamp.

* afm()
Change the coordination number to simulate different lattices.
NOTE: need to energy() to account for all nearest neighbors when changing coordinate number.
